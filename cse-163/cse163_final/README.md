## Running the code
- This project requires the dataset 'countries.geojson' to be in the current working directory.
    It can be downloaded at https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries in the 'Data Files' Section.
- The required libraries can all be installed using the conda-navigator, available here:
    https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator, and/or commands in your computer terminal
- Once you have the required libraries and countries.geojson in the working directory, you can run
    main.py.
- test.py is a script that tests the resulting dataframes of main.py, you can only run it after running main.py.
